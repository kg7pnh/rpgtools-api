        "description": "Also known as the Palladium Megaverse, this is a mostly unified system of rules for a wide range of games by the publisher Palladium Books.",
        "read_me": "Palladium Megaversal\n==\n---\nThe **Megaversal system**, sometimes known as the **Palladium system**, is a set of mechanics specifically employed in most role-playing games published by Palladium Books, with the exception of *Recon*. It uses dice for roll-under percentile skill checks, roll-high combat checks and saving throws, and determination of damage (i.e. Mega Damage is to M.D.C. what \"damage\" is to S.D.C. ) sustained in melee encounters by which a character's Hit Points, Structural Damage Capacity (S.D.C.), or Mega-Damage Capacity (M.D.C.) is reduced accordingly. \n\n## Character Creation\n---\n**Attributes**\n\nCertain aspects of character creation vary across series. Depending upon the game, players may or may not need to select a race; for instance, it is assumed that characters in *Ninjas & Superspies* are human, while in *Palladium Fantasy* they very often are not. Nonetheless, all games share the same eight randomly generated attributes:\n\n* Intelligence Quotient (I.Q.) - The character's level of intelligence.\n* Mental Affinity (M.A.) – The character's personality and how well they can deal with others.\n* Mental Endurance (M.E.) – The character's willpower.\n* Physical Endurance (P.E.) – The character's resistance to physical fatigue.\n* Physical Prowess (P.P.) – The characters agility.\n* Physical Strength (P.S.) – The character's physical strength.\n* Physical Beauty (P.B.) – The character's physical attractiveness.\n* Speed (Spd) – The character's movement speed.\n* Hit Points (H.P.)\n\nFor humans, most of these statistics are determined by a roll of three six-sided dice, whereas other species' attributes are determined more or less depending on how they compare to the baseline human standard.\n\nOther statistics that may be used are:\n\n* Structural Damage Capacity (S.D.C.) – Often supplements hit points; also functions alone as \"hit points\" of non-living objects.\n* Mega Damage Capacity (M.D.C.) – In some cases in certain Mega Damage settings will replace both S.D.C. and H.P. or supplement them.\n* Potential Psychic Energy (P.P.E.) – Energy commonly used for magic and other non-psychic supernatural abilities.\n* Inner Strength Points (I.S.P.) – Energy used for psychic abilities and sometimes magic powers (Mechanoids, Phase World).\n* Bio-Energy (Bio-E) – Used to design mutant animals. Bio-Energy is used for purchasing psionic abilities, animal powers and human traits for mutant animals.\n* Chi (no abbreviation) – Energy used for chi powers in Ninjas & Superspies.\n    Force Points (FP) – Energy used for Force Field and Create Force Constructs in Heroes Unlimited.\n* Power Touch Points (PTP) – Energy used for Power Touch in Powers Unlimited.\n\n**Classes**\n\nThe characters' race and attributes impact their selection of character classes:\n\n* Occupational Character Classes (O.C.C.) – Classes using skills and abilities based on training.\n* Psychic Character Classes (P.C.C.) – Classes focusing on psychic powers.\n* Racial Character Classes (R.C.C.) – Classes using abilities and skills which are primarily a function of race, or are limited to members of a certain race.\n\n**Skills**\n\nDepending upon the game, skills can come either from the character's O.C.C. and a related list, or from the character's educational or occupational background. Games set on modern Earth tend to favor the second; all others favor the first. O.C.C.s tend to be more specific than character classes in other games, with a wide range of O.C.C.s in a given profession, such as six or seven specialized mecha pilot classes in Rifts rather than a single \"Robot/Power Armor Pilot\" class.\n\n**Alignment**\n\nPalladium's alignments are described in detailed terms, outlining how a character will act in a certain situation: whether they will lie, how much force they will use against innocents, how they view the law, and so forth. The alignments are organized into three broad categories: Good, Selfish, and Evil. The seven core alignments are:\n\n* Principled (Good)\n* Scrupulous (Good)\n* Unprincipled (Selfish and also good)\n* Anarchist (Selfish)\n* Miscreant (Evil)\n* Aberrant (Evil)\n* Diabolic (Evil)\n\nAn eighth overall (and third Good) alignment, \"Taoist\", was introduced for Mystic China, but has not seen use outside of that game.\n\nPalladium founder and lead designer Kevin Siembieda has a noted distaste for \"neutral\" alignments (as used in Dungeons & Dragons). This is stated in most core rulebooks in the alignment section, and stems from the idea that a truly neutral character would not do anything particularly interesting, like fight or go on an adventure. \n\n**Other system variations**\n\nEach game has its own variations to make the system better suit its genre. *After the Bomb*, *Splicers*, *Heroes Unlimited* (for mutant animals only), and *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness* use \"Biological Energy\" (BIO-E) points to purchase mutations. *Palladium Fantasy* assumes that non-human characters will be routinely played, so most races will use normal O.C.C.s instead of R.C.C.s.\n\nSome games that feature advanced technology in science fiction settings like *Rifts*, *Robotech*, and *Splicers* use a special category of damage capacity called \"Mega-Damage\" (M.D.C.). An exception is *Mechanoids*. M.D.C. is 100 times more powerful than normal damage (i.e., 1 M.D.C. = 100–199 S.D.C.). Normal weapons cannot damage a Mega-Damage structure at all unless they are capable of inflicting 100 S.D.C. or more in a single shot or burst of ammunition; the archetypal example of Mega-Damage is a tank, which can only be effectively destroyed through the use of powerful weapons designed to overcome its armor, while easily resisting small-arms fire. Many updates to the system in various campaign settings have also added Perception as a statistic. Prior to this it was entirely up to the GM if the player noticed anything.",
