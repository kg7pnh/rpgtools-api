        "read_me": "Going Home\n==\n---\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_It came as quite a surprise when we finally confirmed it. What remained of the big brass in Europe decided that it was time for everyone to get out of the pool, so they arranged for a few ships to take us back to America. Problem was, nobody believed that the ships would have enough room for everybody. We decided that this was the last ride going our way, and it was time to go home. The ships were leaving on November 15, and there were no reserved seats...what with thirty or forty thousand people looking for seats, it could get to be quite a game of musical chairs._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Going Home_ is an adventure for use with GDW's World War III role-playing game, **Twilight: 2000**. In _Going Home_, the players are presented with the challenge with getting across most of Poland and north-central Germany to catch the last ship heading back to the US for quite a while.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the players choose to remain in Europe, _Going Home_ will still be of tremendous interest. The adventure contains:<ul><li>A full-color pull-out map, covering northern Germany which overlaps with the full-color Poland map included in the original game.</li><li>A referee's update of the location and strength of NATO and Warsaw Pact units in their winter quarters as the year 2000draws to a close.</li><li>A brief rundown of French units in the occupied area west of the Rhine and a discussion of French military activities in the so-called \\\"dead zone\\\" east of the Rhine. Also, a bonus: read_mes (in _Twilight: 2000_ terms of three French helicopters.</li><li>Details and specifications, in _Twilight: 2000_ terms, the German Leopard III and the British Challenger tanks, and British 120mm rifled gun.</li></ul>",

Also described are weapons not yet in service or just entering service (such as the Ruger P85), and hypothetical extensions of current firearms technology.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased coverage of both military and civilian rifles is also presented in the _Small Arms Guide_. Submachinegun coverage now includes all major types, from the Tommygun of the 1920s to the most modern suppressed designs, such as the H&K MP5 and Ingram MAC-10.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each weapon entry contains an illustration of that particular firearm, a few short descriptive remarks, and full details for the incorporation of the weapon into the game.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The _Small Arms Guide_ expands the ammunition covered in **Twilight: 2000**, including the ever-popular .357 and .44 magnum rounds.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide also includes a consolidated price and equipment listing for all weapon and ammunition types covered in **Twilight: 2000**. Special essays in the _Small Arms Guide_ cover topics such as reproduction black-powder firearms and the special low-tech auto-rifle, the M16EZ.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The _Small Arms Guide_ is a valuable resource for both players and referees of **Twilight: 2000**, and for anyone who has an interest in modern firearms.",
